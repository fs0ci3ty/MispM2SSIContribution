## Context
This project focuses on cybersecurity and data protection, specifically international data transfer under GDPR. It aims to provide a MISP galaxy for visual analysis of countries' data transfer capabilities in compliance with GDPR regulations.

## Galaxy Purpose
The repository maintains a MISP galaxy that visualizes GDPR-compliant data transfer capabilities. It includes:
- Data structured into a MISP-compatible galaxy and clusters.
- Descriptions of data protection levels within each country's cluster.

## YARA Rule for AIL
Additionally, the project offers a YARA rule for the AIL framework to detect Telegram API keys, contributing to cybersecurity monitoring. The regex used is based on a [specific format](https://stackoverflow.com/a/61888374).
